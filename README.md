ailML Stacked Models Architecture
Project Overview
This repository hosts the architecture for stacked machine learning models developed as a solution for a challenge presented in our Machine Learning course.

Challenge Description
The competition tasked us with predicting the protein expression profile of 25 proteins in 1000 test cells based on the gene expression data of 639 genes. The provided training dataset includes the same data for 4000 cells, enabling the construction of models to predict protein expression levels accurately.

Methodology
We implemented an ensemble approach by stacking various machine learning models. The strategies and models used include but are not limited to:

Adam Optimizer
AdamW Optimizer
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
Further enhancements were made through meticulous hyperparameter tuning and the application of advanced regularization techniques to optimize model performance.

Data
The dataset used in this project cannot be shared publicly. We provide scripts and model structures that can be applied to your dataset. If you're interested in the methodology and would like to test it on your own data, please ensure that your data is structured in a similar format as described in our model documentation.

Repository Structure

/notebook - Colab notebook with exploratory data analysis and pseudo-code for model training experiments.
